# Aivia Inc. Syl Front End Developer Production Test

### Your production test me be submitted on or before: Jan 31st, 2021 @ 5:00PM

# Note to the reviewer

## Welcome to Clever Kitchen

Clever Kitchen is a web app built with React and powered by the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). This web app was built in the context of a 48hour tech challenge for Aivia.

### What does it do?

Users can search for ingredients that they already have on hand in order to find recipes that include these ingredients. The user will be presented with a variety of recipes sorted in order of missing ingredients (ascending). Users can then view the recipe directly on the page, or they can access the source url.

### What more could it do?

Opprtunities for improvement include:
- Refined error handling achievable by investing more time in replicating error cases. 
- A variety of sorting options for the recipe suggestions (diet, ingredients used, cost, not including, etc.).
- Additionaly functionality such as a grocery list feature allowing users to add the missing ingredients directly to a list, their email, etc.

### Additional notes
All in all, I had a really fun time building this. I had fun building something that serves a real purpose and that many people can relate to: what to eat. I also had a fun time exploring with colours that are a bit outside of my usual bright/flashiness. I'm pretty happy with the result, considering the amount of time I spent on it. Excited to hear back!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
